## 🧠 Concepts Covered

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Tokenization | How text is split into tokens (BPE) |
| Embeddings | Dense vector representations of tokens |
| Attention | Q, K, V mechanism — the core innovation |
| Self-Attention | How sequences attend to themselves |
| Multi-Head Attention | Parallel attention heads for richer understanding |
| Positional Encoding | Sinusoidal encoding of word order |
| Encoder | Reading and understanding input |
| Decoder | Auto-regressive text generation |
| LLM Variants | BERT (encoder-only), GPT (decoder-only), T5 (enc-dec) |
